# Temperature Sensor -  TEMP102

The TEMP102 provides fast and precise temperature readings.

Range: typically –40 to +125 °C.


### WHEN TO USE IT?
The sensor offers high precision across a wide temperature range, making it ideal for monitoring elevated temperatures in electronic equipment or any application where accuracy is more important than humidity measurement.


### TEMP102 vs OTHER SENSORS

The [DHT11/DHT22](https://github.com/kingston-hackSpace/DHT11_Humidity_and_Temperature/tree/main) are temperature-and-humidity sensors, ideal for ***environmental temperature*** sensing, when ***humidity*** is also required. They are cheaper than the TEMP102, but offer lower accuracy and a smaller temperature range.

The [Si7021] (pending) is a temperature-and-humidity sensor similar to the DHT11/DHT22, but more precise, however, more expensive.
