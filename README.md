# Temperature Sensor -  TEMP102

The TEMP102 provides fast and precise temperature readings.

### WHEN TO USE IT?
It can handle higher temperatures than a DHT11/DHT22 sensor, wich makes it ideal to monitor high temperature in electronic equipment.

However, the [DHT11/DHT22](https://github.com/kingston-hackSpace/DHT11_Humidity_and_Temperature/tree/main) sensors are ideal for ***environmental*** sensing, when ***humidity*** is also required.
